helps you decide which side to sit while travelling to get minimal damage from sun!

When paranoid people travel in bus they think "Which side should I sit so that I avoid sun light from bus roof"
If you belong to such people...
Congrats... You came at right place.

This is a project that calculates the angle of Sun relative to the path you will travel.
And hence predicts the side the sun will be.

Assuming you will depart right now and will follow the path google maps says.
